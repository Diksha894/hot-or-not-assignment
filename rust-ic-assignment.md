# Brief

Build a TODO app backend CRUD API on the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/). The app should have the following endpoints:

- Add a new todo with the todo text as the input and the created todo ID as the output
- Read an existing todo by id
- Read all todos with pagination
- Update a todo with the next text and existing id
- Delete a todo by id

# Submittable

- URL to the source code repository
- URL to the deployed canister on mainnet

# Additional Information

- The above code is expected to be performant and following best practices
- You should be able to get free cycles from the faucet to deploy your canister on the mainnet. You can find more info [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/cycles/cycles-faucet).
- Make sure to request cycles before you start working on the assignment as it may take some time to get the cycles (usually max 1-2 days)
